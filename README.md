# NATS-Message-Broker
Message oriented middleware to facilitate communication between processes

This is a solo project that is being developed to emulate the primary functionality of NATS in python.

See NATS here: https://github.com/orgs/nats-io/repositories

**Tech used:** Python

## Progress:
Client.py accepts arguements that are held by the running client. 

## Lessons Learned:

I started this project with the intention of utilizing as many foreign topics as possible, and contributing to it in the most professional way I can by standardizing the process of development. This has gotten me experience in various topics so far. Besides the added confidence, since starting this project I've taken steps to document my work through a Trello board, and design documents to both stay on track and contribute code to the project that forsees potential bugs or issues long in advance. Quickly over time projects like these, and those that go on for even years have potentially ruinous bugs, and so contributing in a way to forsee and catch these bugs helps long term development. Past this, before this project I had effectively no experience working in python3 at all, and have gotten seemingly a basic grasp on it's syntax and structure after reviewing other, more professional projects written in it.
